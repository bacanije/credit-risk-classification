# Credit Risk Classificaiton

Using the machine learning model, it allows us to evaluate the lending data to idenitfy creditworthiness of borrowers.

The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

- Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Analysis Report 

The varaibles included in this dataset consisted of:
- 	loan size
- 	interest rate
- 	borrower income
- 	debt to income
- 	num of accounts
- 	derogatory marks
- 	total debt
- 	loan status

## Logistic Regression Model Overview:
The model shows us how well it is performing. Particularly in terms of its ability to correctly identify positive and negative instances, as well as its errors in misclassifying instances as positive when they are negative and vice versa.
